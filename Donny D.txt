 Donny: 

	In Donny's History class, we learned about US History and constructed arguments about key conflicts leading up to and following the Civil War. We studied political, societal, and economic results of various American History events. In this class, students by the end of the year should become stronger analytical and critical thinkers, and this is achieved through the various learning outcomes. Skills we worked on this year include analyzing text. 
	 Donny, your analytical discussions in class was very impressive, and you have demonstrated your strong ability in engaging in logical and salient arguments through speaking and writing.. Your contributions in discussions are always relevant and helpful to your peers.Though you have shown remarkable progress, it would be wise to continue working on analyzing text Given all of your demonstrated progress and depth of knowledge, I highly suggest that you still stop by occasionally in order to extend your knowledge beyond the class targets. You have the material down well, but there is always room to take your work to the next level to prepare for possible future courses. Also, you're a valuable member of class - make sure to stay active in class discussions, and ask questions that can help everyone in the class learn. 
	Donny, you are always raise your hand, and you help strengthen the class environment. On the other hand, you have bad handwriting. In the future, type your work instead, or take a little bit more time when writing out your notes. This will help you understand the textbook reading a bit better. Nonetheless, you have demonstrated amazing progress this semester and your overall grade is an A. Looking forward to your work in the next semester!
