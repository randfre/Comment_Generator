 Charles: 

	In Charles's Math class, we created proofs and solved complex equations and real-world problems. We studied change and growth, on various levels, including looking at population sizing, physics, and other real-world models. In this class, students by the end of the year should become stronger analytical and critical thinkers, and this is achieved through the various learning outcomes. Skills we worked on this year include understanding difficult problems to look for solutions. Another skill worked on this year was sharing the information you discover with your peers. 
	 Charles, your proof of geometric theorem was very impressive, and you have demonstrated your strong ability in understanding difficult problems to look for solutions. Your proof was very detailed and logical.Though you have shown remarkable progress, it would be wise to continue working on sharing the information you discover with your peers Please set up meetings with me; these meetings are very important to ensure that your trajectory leads you to a deeper understanding of the subject rather than disengagement, and can help prepare you for future units when the work gets more difficult. Hopefully with some extra practice we can set you up for success going into the next semester. 
	Charles, you are are always on time, and you help strengthen the class environment. On the other hand, you don't work with table partners. In the future, table partners can contribute valuable information. Make sure to hear their ideas, and let them hear yours.  Nonetheless, you have demonstrated solid progress this semester and your overall grade is a C. Looking forward to your work in the next semester!
