 Bradley: 

	In Bradley's Science class, we studied the behavior of the world through the lens of physics. We examined the relation between calculus and physics through waves, position versus acceleration versus velocity, and also studied energy and energy transfer. In this class, students by the end of the year should become stronger analytical and critical thinkers, and this is achieved through the various learning outcomes. Skills we worked on this year include asking relevant questions about the material. Another skill worked on this year was collaborating effectively with your table partners. 
	 Bradley, your group lab project was very impressive, and you have demonstrated your strong ability in collaborating effectively with your table partners. You demonstrated remarkable growth in collecting and analyzing data. Though you have shown remarkable progress, it would be wise to continue working on demonstrating your understanding of material in your work. Try and find some time during office hours to meet with me. Setting up meetings is incredibly useful for students who are on the cusp of fulling understanding, but just need to talk through their ideas more and gain some confidence. Hopefully with some extra practice we can really elevate your work this next semester. 
	Bradley, you are are always organized, and you help strengthen the class environment. On the other hand, you talk too much. In the future, sit away from friends. Surround yourself with people who can help you succeed. Nonetheless, you have demonstrated great progress this semester and your overall grade is a B. Looking forward to your work in the next semester!
