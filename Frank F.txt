 Frank: 

	In Frank's Math class, we created proofs and solved complex equations and real-world problems. We studied change and growth, on various levels, including looking at population sizing, physics, and other real-world models. In this class, students by the end of the year should become stronger analytical and critical thinkers, and this is achieved through the various learning outcomes. Skills we worked on this year include understanding difficult problems to look for solutions. Another skill worked on this year was sharing the information you discover with your peers. 
	 Frank, your proof by induction of the sum of the series k^3 in terms of n was very impressive, and you have demonstrated your strong ability in sharing the information you discover with your peers. Your proof was very detailed and logcial. I could tell you hadn't just memorized the proof itself, but rather figured it out using your strong logic and reasoning skills. Though you have shown remarkable progress, it would be wise to continue working on understanding difficult problems to look for solutions Try and find some time during office hours to meet with me. Setting up meetings is incredibly useful for students who are on the cusp of fulling understanding, but just need to talk through their ideas more and gain some confidence. Hopefully with some extra practice we can really elevate your work this next semester. 
	Frank, you are are leader in class, and you help strengthen the class environment. On the other hand, you talk too much sometimes. In the future, try to let other kids talk as well. You can learn something from their insights. Nonetheless, you have demonstrated great progress this semester and your overall grade is a B. Looking forward to your work in the next semester!
