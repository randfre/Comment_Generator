 Emily: 

	In Emily's Coding class, we learned how to solve real-world problems in Python. The class studied data structures, functions, file reading, and other various intermediate coding skills. In this class, students by the end of the year should become stronger analytical and critical thinkers, and this is achieved through the various learning outcomes. Skills we worked on this year include articulating your work to your peers. Another skill worked on this year was creativelying look for solutions to unique coding problems. 
	 Emily, your final game project was very impressive, and you have demonstrated your strong ability in articulating your work to your peers. Your project worked well and was very interesting.Though you have shown remarkable progress, it would be wise to continue working on creativelying look for solutions to unique coding problems Please set up meetings with me; I am very concerned about how you are understanding the material. These meetings are very important to ensure that your trajectory leads you to a deeper understanding of the subject rather than disengagement. As the class continues to progress, the information builds on itself, and if your foundations are shaky, the rest of your knowledge will continue to maintain surface-level. 
	Emily, you are ask good questions, and you help strengthen the class environment. On the other hand, you don't comment code. In the future, commenting code helps with longer pieces of code. This will help you on the more difficult problems you tend to struggle with. Nonetheless, you have demonstrated some progress this semester and your overall grade is a D. Looking forward to your work in the next semester!
