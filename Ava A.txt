 Ava: 

	In Ava's English class, we practiced analytical reading and annotation skills using some of the most acclaimed literature of the 20th century. We also practiced creative writing, analytical writing, poetry, and memoir writing skills. In this class, students by the end of the year should become stronger analytical and critical thinkers, and this is achieved through the various learning outcomes. Skills we worked on this year include reading analytically and intentionally. Another skill worked on this year was writing clearly and purposefully. 
	 Ava, your argumentative essay about George Orwell's "1984" was very impressive, and you have demonstrated your strong ability in reading analytically and intentionally. Your analysis of the phrase "Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past." helped strengthen your argument nicely. Though you have shown remarkable progress, it would be wise to continue working on writing clearly and purposefully Given all of your demonstrated progress and depth of knowledge, I highly suggest that you still stop by occasionally in order to extend your knowledge beyond the class targets. You have the material down well, but there is always room to take your work to the next level to prepare for possible future courses. Also, you're a valuable member of class - make sure to stay active in class discussions, and ask questions that can help everyone in the class learn. 
	Ava, you are very funny and always making people laugh, and you help strengthen the class environment. On the other hand, you tend to disruptively eat in class. In the future, eat a snack before class. Staying more focused on the class environment will help your skills blossom further. Nonetheless, you have demonstrated amazing progress this semester and your overall grade is an A. Looking forward to your work in the next semester!
